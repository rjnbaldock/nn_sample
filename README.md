This work and this repo are fresh! I'll soon complete this README, but for now, why not take a look at my report (report.pdf)?

In the code I have referred "Parallel Tempering". This is the name for Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics when you replace the Molecular Dynamics (MD) with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). My code is completely agnostic to the Monte Carlo approach used. I've implemented Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), which is intermediate to MD and MCMC. I chose to use the name Parallel Tempering when writing the code. You'll be able to read about my implementation in the report very soon.
